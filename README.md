## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Can from TÃ¼rkiye; Learning Design, Development, and Analytics is a Computer Engineer. I realized that the area I enjoyed most was data, while I was primarily doing Unity Game Development and Game Design. Currently learning Python, Power BI, SQL, Tableau, and everything related to data analysis.
